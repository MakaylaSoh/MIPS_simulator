lab 2 description: 
Write a java program that reads and translates a asm file to binary!! YAY :D

1. R type instructions
- 6bit op, 5bit rs, 5bit rt, 5bit rd, 5bit shamt, 6bit funct
- op is always 000000
- rs, rt, and rd represent the registers. registers correspond to a number
- if there are no shift amount then shamt is 00000

2. I type instructions
- 6bit op, 5bit rs, 5bit rt, 16bit constant or address
- op is defined in reference
- rs is the source, rt is the destination, constant is the amount adding onto the value in rs

3. J type instructions
- only have 6op, rest is address

Data Stuctures?
hashmaps
- need an arraylist to hold the labels' address 
  (address will be of the instruction AFTER the label)
- ignore comments!
- to hold the registers and instructions
- to hold R instructions fucnt (opcode is always 0)
- to hold I instructions
- to hold J instructions
